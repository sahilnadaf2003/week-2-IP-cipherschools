            A paragraph is a series of sentences on a specific point or topic.
            A well written paragraph must have a topic sentence which states the main idea:
            what the paragraph is about.While some say the  topic sentence can be anywhere in the paragraph,
            it is best to put it as the first sentence in a paragraph.  
            The rest of the sentences in the paragraph support, elaborate, and/or further explain the main idea expressed in the topic sentence.
